sample script

---------------------------------

these are 5 sample quests using quest log system

this was actually made as a sample script inside a script support section in eathena forum  
original topic from eathena  
thanks to paradog eathena admin that makes eathena forum down, almost gonna remake everything from scratch  
luckily I got a few segment here and there in my old hard-disk so doesn't take too much time to write this sample  

#### Quest #1  
typical talk to npc A, then npc B ... etc  
demonstrate how to use `*checkquest`  

#### Quest #2
collect item quest  
just checkitem with it  
I still don't know how to use the client to trace is the item collecting has completed or not  

#### Quest #3
kill monster quest  
demonstrate how to use `*checkquest( x, HUNTING )`  

#### Quest #4
typical talk to npc A, then npc B ... BUT with a time limit  
demonstrate how to use `*checkquest( x, PLAYTIME )`  

#### Quest#5
if player having this quest, player can `*getitem` by killing this monster
