## This repo is clone from google drive
Github has come a long way to let me trust to use it again  
its time to re-host all my files into Github ... simply by Git-push from my google drive folder :P  
yup, you'll see all the `desktop.ini` file ... these are google drive files  
its the same if you view this from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2BM920mmHQgVjEwc0VYeEtiNUk&usp=drive_web&pli=1&ddrp=1#list), you'll also see all the .git files

Just having 1 folder from my computer, automatically sync to google drive, also sync in Github, isn't that great ?
