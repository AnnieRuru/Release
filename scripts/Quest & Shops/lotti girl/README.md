so today I try to gather them all, and make a release with ALL features from all the topics gathered

### Download:
script


#### Feature no.1 -> show the percentage chance
![screen2019Hercules030.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/screen2019Hercules030.jpg)  
chinese government has a rule that all lottery system must show the percentage chance to the public  
hence the script should show the lottery chance in percent

#### Feature no.2 -> Roll Repeatedly
imagine if you have 500 tickets, and you want to spend them all,  
all other scripts available on rathena board will force the player to spend them 1 by 1  
this script can roll up to 100 times on the fly, effectively save player's time

#### Feature no.3 -> Lotti shop
even if you spend a lot of tickets and still getting all the trash items,  
you still collecting points, and able buy them in Lotti Shop

#### Feature no.4 -> Lotti ladder
compete with other players and see who has the highest Lotti Rank !


oh and ... HULD compatible :innocent: == rAthena members can't use this
