http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/15250/how-to-do-a-case-sensitive-search-in-where-clause

by default, the table creation use charset = latin1;
means it couldn't do a case-sensitive search

if you want to do a case-sensitive in a query, use BINARY

select * from `char` where name = binary('AnnieRuru');

however using BINARY might have performance hit if it is a big table
so its more recommend to convert your sql table to collate with latin1_general_cs


let's say this is a sample table

create table testtest (
id int(11) primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(23)
)engine = innodb;

do an alter table syntax

alter table testtest modify column name varchar(23) collate latin1_general_cs;

or just put it into the table creation

create table testtest (
id int(11) primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(23)
)engine = innodb default charset = latin1 collate latin1_general_cs;
