## This repo is clone from google drive
Github has come a long way to let me trust to use it again  
its time to re-host all my files into Github ... simply by Git-push from my google drive folder :P  
yup, you'll see all the `desktop.ini` file ... these are google drive files  
its the same if you view this from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2BM920mmHQgVjEwc0VYeEtiNUk&usp=drive_web&pli=1&ddrp=1#list), you'll also see all the .git files

Just having 1 folder from my computer, automatically sync to google drive, also sync in Github, isn't that great ?

yes, the purpose why I started hosting this on Google Drive, and Github later, was because there was a member claimed 1 of my scripts  
https://rathena.org/board/topic/75477-custom-bg/?do=findComment&comment=176806  
and sell to another server for $40  
that member showed me a battleground script he bought for $40 and I immediately spot it was belongs to mine  
after this incident I started to host all my scripts here
