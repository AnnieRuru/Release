Assassination event
A GM creates a monster on the selected map (from the map mobs list) with a different name (like "target", or "kiel this monster" ) and the participants' task is to find that monster and eliminate it (while leaving the rest of the flora and fauna unharmed).

Delivery race
Not a big surpire, the participants have to deliver something(s) to somewhere(s). If not interesting enough, you can add "obstacles" to their way. (even harming each other if this could be done)

(ahh, these puns T_T)

Guess who
First the GM, later the winner of the last round thinks of a monster, and others have to find out which one he thought of. Only decidable (y/n) questions can be asked.

Torpedo*
What great feature of the game is the /where command! We can utilize it for gaming! There are two teams, each one assings a 4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x10 (depending on participants' number) area as their "sea" and the players will be the boats (or ships...). The opposite team members cannot be on the same screen ofc. After that the two teams start to shooting missles (sending coordinates in chat) to each other and the goal is to hit every enemy player. (hint: god bless the trapper hunters)

(Background) story writing event
The GM names a monster/place/item and the participants have to write a little story/poem/novel/anything about it. The best ones could be posted in a new section on the origins ro website.

MASSter hunters
The opposing teams ( >=2 ) have a monster name and a time limit to hunt as much of the tartgeted creature as they could.


These are just suggestions, I could work out the details if any of these are wanted, or suggest some more.  ;)

EDIT: * Torpedo = battleship (sorry, in my native language this game is called Torpedo, not battleship...)
