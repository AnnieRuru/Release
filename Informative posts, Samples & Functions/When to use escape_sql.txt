since there are no other topic have better resource on this
ok I can write a 3 pages documentation just for this command

QUOTE <ultramage>
	if the message contains " or ' or some such special character, then after it gets combined into a single string, it will not form a correct query
END QUOTE

CODE
	input .@haha$;
	dispbottom .@haha$;
	dispbottom escape_sql(.@haha$);
END CODE

it doesn't has much different, because it only affect 3 special characters
' <- single quotation mark
" <- double quotation mark
\ <- left slash

if I input -> haha"lala'hehe <-
it will return -> haha\"lala\'hehe <-
this is what we call, escaping a string

in eathena script, we also know we can use " symbol in any string input
CODE
	mes "Susan says :\" Today I ate 3 eggs \".";
	where in the game client, you can see the " symbol in the npc msg box
END CODE

============================================================


let's say I have a sql script like this

CODE
prontera,153,171,5	script	sdfsdf	100,{
	mes "input name, I'll show you all characters name it has on that player's account";
	input .@name$;
	set .@row, query_sql("select char_id, name from `char` where name like '"+ .@name$ +"'", .@num$, .@name$);
	if ( !.@row ) {
		mes "no result";
		close;
	}
	for ( set .@i, 0; .@i < .@row; set .@i, .@i +1 )
		mes .@num$[.@i] +" "+ .@name$[.@i];
	close;
}
END CODE

this script has a possibility to be hacked
because to perform sql injection, I can enclose the string with quotation mark, then use another sql command to hack

BUT with an escape_sql command, if the user want to enclose the string with quotation mark to hack the script
the escape_sql command escaped the string, the quotation mark the user input will be escaped
thus the script will become impossible to hack

===============================================================

there are 2 common method to prevent hacking with sql script

just now that script was for string input

CODE
prontera,153,171,5	script	sdfsdf	100,{
	mes "input account ID, I'll show you all characters name it has on that player's account";
	input .@aid$;
	set .@row, query_sql("select char_id, name from `char` where account_id = "+ escape_sql(.@aid$), .@num$, .@name$);
	if ( !.@row ) {
		mes "no result";
		close;
	}
	for ( set .@i, 0; .@i < .@row; set .@i, .@i +1 )
		mes .@num$[.@i] +" "+ .@name$[.@i];
	close;
}
END CODE

this is a stupid case.
1. the scripter use string input while the script just needed a number
2. even with escape_sql command over there, there is no quotation mark at all
yes this script also has a risk to be hack

because escape_sql only escape quotation mark.
that hacker don't even have to input quotation mark because it is a number
and an injection query can be sent without any quotation mark input

there are 2 ways to solve this
either use numeric variable for the input command
or enclose that

CODE
	..... where account_id = '"+ escape_sql(.@aid$) +"'", ....
END CODE

with single quotation mark, where the hacker input a quotation mark will be escaped by escape_sql command

==============================================================

escape_sql command for another thing is
if the player register their names containing ' or ", these characters are escaped

	I'm having this DB error with the script:

	CODE

	I'm using SVN 12077. But this error only happens when that certain guild would have a kill.

Silo's Babies <-- I don't understand what language is that
but you can see the 5th string has a single quotation mark

with escape_sql command, that string will turn into
Silo\'s Babies <-- the quotation mark is escaped when send to sql query
