## Compare Battleground script between rAthena & Hercules

I have 2 samples:

1. [Topic in Hercules](http://herc.ws/board/topic/15913-annieruru-emp-bg/)  
[script for Hercules](https://github.com/AnnieRuru/customs/blob/master/scripts/instanced_bg_emp.txt), [script for rAthena](https://github.com/AnnieRuru/customs/blob/master/scripts/instanced_bg_emp_r.txt)
2. Same topic in [Hercules](http://herc.ws/board/topic/15915-a-battleground-idea-d/) & [rAthena](https://rathena.org/board/topic/115744-a-battleground-idea-d/)  
[script for Hercules](https://github.com/AnnieRuru/customs/blob/master/scripts/bg_assassination.txt), [script for rAthena](https://github.com/AnnieRuru/customs/blob/master/scripts/bg_assassination_r.txt)

Both scripts behave the same in-game on their counterpart.  
But the script commands are entirely different.

<details>
<summary>History</summary>

When the battleground system first introduced into Ragnarok Online,  
[Zephyrus](https://rathena.org/board/topic/115250-hello-again-i-am-back/) coded the battleground script commands into eAthena emulator.  
It's very old system ... required waitingroom to function ...  
because of that, [the battleground script that was meant for eamod](https://github.com/AnnieRuru/customs/blob/master/scripts/bg_pvp_leader_e.txt) is compatible with both rAthena and Hercules

BUT !! members hated the waitingroom system, so I decided to make my own patch for [rAthena](https://rathena.org/board/topic/72571-battleground-system-without-waitingroom/) and [Hercules](http://herc.ws/board/topic/4570-outdated-battleground-system-without-waitingroom/)

Officially, Hercules made its first move to introduce [queue related script commands](http://herc.ws/board/topic/928-memory-slasher-may-30-patch/)  
however during its release, [it was plague with bugs](http://herc.ws/board/topic/8882-queue-2-new-commands/?do=findComment&comment=65329) ...  
later ... [rAthena made its own battleground script command](https://github.com/rathena/rathena/pull/1534)

And here we are now, both have its own style to write a battleground script

... and my custom patch for both emulator is now outdated
