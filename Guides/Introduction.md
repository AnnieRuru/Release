## Introduction

Hihi~ I am a Scripter for both [Hercules](http://herc.ws/board/) and [rAthena](https://rathena.org/board/) emulator  
pretty helpful while I was around ~ usually helping around Scripting section,  
although I am leaning towards hercules side  
I can do a little source edits, but not too confident about it...  
My strongest point is writing **event scripts** ~ I might be unable to deny your battleground script request ~

PS: while I am around -> means -> you know what it is üòÅ  
since I can inactive for several months ... sometimes ~

I started scripting since year 2007.  
I had 2 teachers at the time on eAthena forum. Yhn and Trancid.  
Somewhere around Aug 2007, I received a PM asking to be a Scripting Moderator for eathena forum.  
Maybe because I was being helpful on the forum ? LOL ~  
I quickly answer "Yes" at that time, and joined as eAthena staff member ever since.  
Currently I am **Script Developer** for Hercules.

The reason why I am started this guide because:-  
1. Write certain scripting guides that I'm not too confident to publish on the forum or wiki  
2. Some thoughts about the current trend of Hercules or rAthena emulator
