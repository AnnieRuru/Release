Looks fun ?  
however this event is not control by scripts, but entirely control by GM commands

#### This is how you do it
Step 1: login multi 2 GM clients, then `@hide` both of them  
Step 2: `@warp g_room1-1 75 153`, then `@duel` between them  
Step 3: one GM `@summon 1916 60`, another GM `@summon 2022 60`

Enjoy the result

Note: have to `@summon 1916 60` with the `60` on it,  
without 60, it will last only 1 minute, but with 60, it will last 60 minutes

weird, the retaliate to master is no longer needed, I leave it as yes

```
// When a mob is attacked by another monster, will the mob retaliate against the master of said mob instead of the mob itself?
// NOTE: Summoned mobs are both those acquired via @summon and summoned by Alchemists
retaliate_to_master: yes
```
